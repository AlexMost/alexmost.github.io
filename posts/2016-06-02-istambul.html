<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2916.jpg" /></p>
<p>Last weekend I had an opportunity to visit one of the most populous city in Turkey - Istanbul. It was my first time visiting Turkey at all. I was travelling in a company of 6 friends and we had a great time there. First of all, I can say that it is a perfect city to spend your weekend. So if you have some doubts about visiting Istanbul you should go ahead and don’t hesitate to visit it).</p>
<p>We were there for 4 days. Visited a lot of places and walked a huge amount of kilometers. I will try to highlight the most interesting places that I have seen there and suggest you to visit.</p>
<p>Here is our awesome company though (Blue Mosque on a background):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_0078.jpg" /></p>
<p>We were leaving not far away from that place (a couple of stops by tram).</p>
<h1 id="blue-mosque">Blue Mosque</h1>
<p>Here is the Blue Mosque by itself (huge and breathtaking): <img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/6.jpg" /></p>
<p>Inside the Blue Mosque:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2835.jpg" /></p>
<p>People allowed to visit it only without shoes. Man must be in pants (not shorts) and women must cover their head with a shawl. Don’t worry if you haven’t nor pants nor shawl - you can take them near the entrance for free.</p>
<p>Also there is a big and soft carpet inside, so you can just sit on the floor:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_0075.jpg" /></p>
<p>It’s really awesome and big:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2827.jpg" /></p>
<p>Also very beautiful at night:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2865.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is also awesome color phountain there:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2871.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/5.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here is another one mosque just in front of the Blue Mosque - Hagia Sophia</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2876.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="topkapı-palace">Topkapı Palace</h1>
<p>It’s a large palace and it was the major residence of Ottoman sultans and their harem. This place will take you at least a half of the day to visit.</p>
<p>Palace entrance gate (only sultan was allowed to enter it):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2878.jpg" /></p>
<p>Inside the sultan harem (if I got everything right this room was for sultan’s mother):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2882.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another room where sultan was meeting guests:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/8.jpg" /></p>
<p>Some part of harem from the outside:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2887.jpg" /></p>
<p>Me and beautiful sight on a Bosphorus from the palaсe courtyard on the background:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2892.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another awesome sight from there:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2901.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="ferry-walk-across-the-bosphorus">Ferry walk across the Bosphorus</h1>
<p>Quite cheap but impressive ride on a ferry - just for 12 TL (nearly 4$):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2920.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2917.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2922.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/3.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="istanbul-saphire">Istanbul Saphire</h1>
<p>The tallest building in Istanbul and it has an awesome observatory on the last floor. You can have some coffee there and just watch the sunset. We spent a couple of hours there (also quite cheap place to visit something near 25 TL - 8$).</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/2.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/1.jpg" /></p>
<p>We decided to wait there until sunset to have a look on a night Istanbul and it was really worth an hour of waiting:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2978.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2987.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="bazaar">Bazaar</h1>
<p>I was really impressed by Istanbul bazaar. Turkish people are real trade masters. They like to bargain and do it really well.</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2923.jpg" /></p>
<p>All sorts of spices, nuts and dried fruits</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2924.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2925.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_3004.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="some-random-street-photo-shots">Some random street photo shots</h1>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2815.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2874.jpg" /></p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2953.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="hookah">Hookah</h1>
<p>You can have hookah almost everywhere in Istanbul. Actually, I can not say that that was the best hookah that I have ever tried. No, it was quite good, but not as good as I had been told before. To my surprise, the most famous hookah place is situated not far from the old cemetery. It’s called “Erenler Nargile” (Nargile is hookah in Turkish). Suggest you to visit, really worth it, the best hookah that I have tasted in Turkey.</p>
<p>Here is a photo from there:</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_3017.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here is me also smoking :)</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_3015.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="our-apartment">Our apartment</h1>
<p>We were lucky to rent an apartment not far from the historical center but right in front of the jail. Yes, the real prison with real prisoners right near the house! The most unusual place that I have ever stayed yet. And besides, there are a lot of restaurants and bars around that jail. People are dancing and singing almost every day and night. In fact, we were told that it’s not the safest place to stay from local people)</p>
<p>Here is a nice sight right out from the window (thank you airbnb):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2813.jpg" /></p>
<p>At the same time you see this in the opposite direction (jail is still behind you, remember?):</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/7.jpg" /></p>
<p>Party hard</p>
<p><img class="lazyload" src="../images/istambul/IMG_2931.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In any case, we had a great weekend there. There are still left a lot of places to see there so I am looking forward visiting this city again.</p>
